Feature: Header
  As a user of BNF
  I want to be able to use the header to navigate and search

  Background:
    Given I open the home page

# TODO these tests need fixing
 # Scenario: Use autocomplete to get a search suggestion for a topic name
 #   When I type "Para" in the header search box
 #   Then I expect to see "Paracetamol (BNF drugs/monographs)" in the autocomplete suggestions

 # Scenario: Navigate straight to a topic from an autocomplete suggestion
 #   Given I type "Para" in the header search box
 #   When I click "Paracetamol" in the autocomplete options
 #   Then I expect the url to contain "paracetamol"
